Research Objective: Determine how freeze-thaw history influenced soil carbon response to additional, experimental freeze-thaw disturbance. 

Approach: We used soils from two sites in Alaska with contrasting environmental histories (Healy - high frequency of freeze-thaw cycles, Toolik - low frequency of freeze-thaw cycles) to address our hypothesis. We used Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance to probe the effects of site, depth, and experimental freeze-thaw on the nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC), hydrogen and oxygen saturation, and the relative abundances of aliphatic, aromatic, condensed aromatic, and lignin-like compounds. 


Hypotheses: Healy and upper soil depths with greater freeze-thaw history would have a larger influence of lignin-like and aromatic compounds due to preferential turnover of aliphatic compounds during prior freeze-thaw (or extended periods of thaw). Following experimental freeze-thaw, we expected Toolik and lower mineral depths with little freeze-thaw history to undergo microbial cell lysis and carbon desorption associated with ionic fluctuations during freeze-thaw, resulting in decreases to the aliphatic pool and an overall increase in oxidation of molecules.
